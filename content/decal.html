                            This course is a deep dive into the creation of games, from beginning to end. Over the course of the semester, students will pitch a game, form small teams, and build a project from start to finish with help from the instructors. Students are not required to have any prior game development experience but it is required that a student taking the course either has basic art, music or programming abilities. 
                            <br><br>
                            They will also learn about the different roles that exist within the industry, how to apply their skills to them, and form an understanding about how to best prepare themselves to find their way into these roles. This will be a rigorous class, one that will require a lot of time and dedication. Students will be selected via the <strong>application due Friday, January 20 at 11:59 PM,</strong> to ensure that the class composition reflects a diverse range of skills, backgrounds, and proficiency levels.

                        This class is open to both programmers and artists. You are not required to have any prior game
                        development experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The class meets <strong>twice a week</strong>, for an hour and a half each meeting and <strong>attendance
                            is required.</strong>
                        For the first four weeks, meetings will be tutorial lectures, designed to provide students with
                        knowledge of how the Unity engine works and best practices for implementing game mechanics.
                        The majority of the classes for the first half of the course will be in the form of hands-on lab
                        assignments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Project teams are formed around Week 6 and the course will assume the following structure:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first ~20 minutes of class will be a short lecture. On the first class of the week, a project work meeting will follow.
                        On the second class of the week there will be a work day following. Occasionally, the second class of the week will be 
                        replaced with a guest lecture or playtest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the project work meetings:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teams will meet, check in with a facilitator about their progress, and plan their work schedule for
                        the next week.
                        Teams will work on their projects and get help from facilitators.
                        The lectures from Week 6 onward will be determined during the semester based on what the students
                        need. The lectures will come from a variety of sources: instructors, industry contacts, alumni, and
                        possibly the students themselves.

                    <p>
                        Programmers will follow along a series of tutorial videos to create a game
                        from scratch. After completing the game, each student will be required to design and
                        implement their own mechanics, artwork, or SFX and music. This project will reinforce
                        key concepts introduced in the lectures given in the first four weeks of the class.
                        Programmers will learn the fundamentals of creating a project in Unity by following the
                        tutorial. Artists will learn to create and incorporate their own assets by designing and
                        importing their own assets into a mechanically completed game.

                    <p>
                        A one week &#34;game jam&#34; type project where the goal is to try and build a game in a week. The
                        main purpose of this project is to teach students about scope and what can be done in a week. It will
                        also serve as a way for each student to see what kind of group dynamic works best for them.

                    <h6>Project 3</h6>
                    <p>
                        The flagship project for the course is a game designed and built by the
                        students themselves over the course of approximately two months. Students will begin
                        preparing pitches in Week 5 with guidance from the instructors, and will present their
                        pitches to the entire class in Week 6. Students will then select which projects they are
                        interested in, and the instructors will form teams based on their interests and skills.
                        From there on out, the teams will work with the instructors and their team leads to
                        create a schedule. The instructors will also assign labs to each team based on the
                        project that team is working on; the labs will provide the team with resources that will be
                        useful to know when working on the project. While working on the project, the teams will
                        work with and receive feedback from the facilitators and other students. All projects will
                        be graded based on how well they achieve five milestones.

                    <p>
                        At each milestone, all projects are shared with the rest of the class. These milestones are as
                        follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Milestone 0:</strong> Each team is expected to have a game design document completed.
                        The design document needs to include an explanation for the vision of the game
                        as well as the specifics for the core aspects of the game. The teams are also
                        expected to create a week by week breakdown of tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Milestone 1:</strong>  Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Playable prototype of the original
                        pitch. The core mechanics and the first iteration of the core art assets of the
                        game should be implemented. Effectively this milestone exists to ensure that the
                        games are fun, and to provide teams with feedback regarding how their game
                        can be improved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Milestone 2:</strong> Alpha Build: All of the main mechanics should be in place. The
                        general art style should be decided on and the main assets (character,
                        environment) should be in place. A first pass should be done on the rest of the
                        art assets. There should be a basic but complete level as intended to appear in
                        the final game. This build can have bugs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Milestone 3:</strong> Beta Build: The main mechanics should no longer have any bugs.
                        Most of the art assets should be completed and in the game. The game and its
                        levels should be mostly complete. This build needs to have a certain level of
                        polish; having a few small bugs and incomplete minor assets is fine at this build.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Milestone 4 (showcase):</strong> Release Build: Finished Project. The game should be
                        complete, and in line with the original pitch. It should be polished, playable from
                        start to finish, and mostly bug free.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At each milestone, team members will fill out team evaluations that will be factored into your
                        grade.

                    <p>
                        In the first few weeks, students will work through instructor made, CS-style labs
                        that are focused on teaching a particular aspect of Unity that will aid students in making

                    <p>
                        Students will be responsible for several written assignments. One is a reflection
                        for project 2 to journal their progress within the week that they develop their game. The
                        second is a game design document for the final project that details the design of your
                        game as well as a week by week breakdown of tasks. Lastly students will be required to
                        submit a short write-up detailing their thoughts on the project and the course as a
                        whole.

                        Students will be required to read one article on game design concepts and
                        principles every week. Basic questions will be asked to the students to ensure that
                        students have been keeping up with the required readings. A link to each week’s
                        reading is provided in the syllabus below and also posted on the course website.

                        Attendance matters! If you cannot be at class, you <strong>must</strong> let an instructor and your team lead know.
                        Only two unexcused absences will be allowed, and any further absences will result in your grade
                        dropping <strong>10% per absence</strong>. If you are in danger of not passing come the end of the semester, the
                        instructors will let people know what can be done to remedy that.

                                        GameObjects, are covered in this lab from their creation as well as their use.
                                        Enemies will be derived from a base prefab called Enemy, and students will create a
                                        new enemy based off of the Prefab.

                                        In this lab, you’ll create smooth transitions between 2D animations using Blend
                                        Trees. Blend trees are a must for organizing complicated animation transitions in
                                        Animator. They’re used to quickly handle transitions between animations when the
                                        player provides new input. In 3D games, they actually interpolate between the two
                                        animations, creating a smooth transition. We will only be going over the 2D
                                        version, but all the concepts apply to 3D animations.

                                        of animation principles, we will be introducing two methods of creating animations:
                                        a sprite-based method, and a puppet-based method that uses many of the tools that
                                        3D animations use.

                                        In this lab, you’ll learn how to use Tilemaps to create a level. It will go over
                                        the process of cutting a spritesheet and assigning sprites to specific tiles. The
                                        Unity implemented Tilemap is able to easily create new levels with specific tiles
                                        that contain rules, animations, randomizationndom generation, and tile setting
                                        conditions. It is an easy way to make many levels and, once set up, easy for
                                        everyone of all programming levels to do. With more programming, more unique
                                        brushes, rulesets and randomization can be created to generate dynamic levels
                                        without the hassle of gameobjects and prefabs.

                                        manipulated, and animating is the actual animation of the model using the joints
                                        and bones.
